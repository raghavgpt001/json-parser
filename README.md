# JSON Parser

This is a simple Python script that validates whether a given input string is a valid JSON string. It checks the syntax and structure of the input string to determine its validity.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd json-parser
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your JSON file in the project directory.

2. Open the `main.py` file and modify the `file_path` variable to specify the path to your JSON file.

3. Run the script:
```
python main.py
```

The script will read and parse the JSON file, and then validate its contents.

If the JSON is valid, it will display "Valid JSON". Otherwise, it will display "Invalid JSON".
